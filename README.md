This project was originally for my own private personal use, but I am deciding to make this a repository anyway.

This is also my first time using vias on a PCB layout!

The circuit was tested with a 74HC244 IC and TJTAG 3.0.1. and 3.0.2.1 on a few machines with success barring issues with using one 74HC244; replacing it with another 74HC244 from the same set fixed the recognition issue. This is why a 74HCT244 is recommended with this circuit.
